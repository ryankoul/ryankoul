# About me 👋
- 👨‍💻 Background:
    - I studied economics and philosophy in college
    - While there I learned how to write and do math, but not code. Most economics-y analysis jobs were beyond my skill level
    - So I dove into data science and engineering to upskill, and now have familiarity with the whole data pipeline
